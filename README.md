# SVM based on MATLAB

In this project, we try to illustrate and understand the principal of support vector machine and the derivative convex optimization problem. Based on MATLAB and CVX package, we implement hard-margin, soft-margin SVMs on solving the linear separable and non-separable problem. Furthermore, to get a non-linear classification model with a higher complexity, kernel trick is introduced to the hard and soft SVMs so that non-linear problems can be solved linearly in a higher dimensional space. We implement our kernel trick SVMs on the real data to verify the feasibility and found that linear kernel and polynomial kernel work better in this case though Gaussian kernel is widely used in most of time. After learning convex optimization, we have a deeper understanding of the principals about supporting vector machine andWe will keep learning SVMs and convex problems in the future.

* This code need to install CVX package before use it.
